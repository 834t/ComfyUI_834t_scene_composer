# Scene Composer for ComfyUI
 
An intuitive, all-in-one node for ComfyUI that brings a powerful, layer-based regional prompting workflow directly into your graph. Say goodbye to managing countless `Conditioning (Set Area)` nodes and hello to drawing your creative vision.

Created by **[834t](https://github.com/834t)**.

## ‚ú® Features

The Scene Composer is more than just a node; it's a complete toolkit designed to streamline your workflow and unlock new creative possibilities.

*   **üé® Layer-Based Drawing Interface:** Work with multiple layers, just like in your favorite image editor. Each layer is represented by a color.
*   **‚úçÔ∏è Per-Layer Control:** Assign a unique prompt, opacity, and visibility to each layer for precise control over your composition.
*   **üõ†Ô∏è Intuitive Tools:** Comes equipped with a **Brush**, **Line**, and **Eraser** tool. 
*   **üß† Smart Mask Normalization:** An optional (`normalize_masks`) feature that intelligently blends overlapping regions, preventing concept "burn-in" and creating more coherent images.
*   **üìù Automatic Base Prompt:** Optionally (`add_base_prompt`) create a global conditioning from all layer prompts, helping to unify the overall style and theme of the image.
*   **üíæ Save & Load Scene State:**
    *   Save your entire scene (all drawings, prompts, and settings) to a `.json` file with the "S" button.
    *   Load a scene from a file with the "L" button.
    *   Your scene is automatically saved within the ComfyUI workflow itself, so you'll never lose your work!

## üöÄ How to Use

1.  **Add the Node:** Right-click on the canvas and select `Add Node > Workflow > Composers > Scene Composer (834t)`.
2.  **Set Dimensions:** Adjust the `width` and `height` widgets to your desired output size.
3.  **Select a Layer:** Click on a color in the palette to activate a layer.
4.  **Write a Prompt:** In the text area, write the prompt for the selected layer (e.g., "a beautiful mountain range").
5.  **Draw:** Use the brush, line, or eraser tools to draw the mask for that concept on the canvas.
6.  **Adjust Opacity:** Use the opacity slider to control the influence of the layer.
7.  **Repeat:** Select other colors to create new layers for other concepts (e.g., "a serene lake in the foreground", "a sky full of stars").
8.  **Connect:**
    *   Connect the `latent` output to your KSampler's `latent_image` input.
    *   Connect the `positive` output to your KSampler's `positive` input.
9.  **Queue Prompt** and watch the magic happen!

| **IN**  | `width`/`height`  | The dimensions of the output latent space and drawing canvas.                                           |
| **IN**  | `normalize_masks` | (Boolean) If true, normalizes the weight of overlapping masks to prevent artifacts. **Recommended: True**. |

| **OUT** | `latent`          | An empty latent image of the specified dimensions.                                                      |
| **OUT** | `positive`        | The combined positive conditioning from all your drawn layers.                                          |
